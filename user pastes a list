user pastes a list
user presses start

breaks the list into individual items
shows user the first two items
** If they click the first item **
- it swaps the position, moving it further in the array
- it checks to see if there is an item AFTER the second of the two
**** If there is ****
-- it then moves to the next index in the array
**** If there is not ****
-- it returns to the beginning of the list


** If they click the second item **
- it moves to the next index in the array

If a pair has already been compared, it should remember the pair and not ask the user for that comparison again

If it goes through every pair without swapping anything, the list is done.
finally, it flips the list and displays it
